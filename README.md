# South Indian Movie Reviews Classification

Welcome to the South Indian Movie Reviews Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources for building and deploying a sentiment analysis model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The model classifies South Indian movie reviews based on sentiment, providing valuable insights into audience feedback.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to analyze movie reviews and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The primary features used for classification include:
- Movies
- Comments
- Sentiment
The project is deployed using Streamlit, creating an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model.

## Features
- Sentiment Analysis: Classifies movie reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- Interactive Interface: Deployed with Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use interface for users to input their reviews and get sentiment analysis results.
- Comprehensive Analysis: Handles a variety of comments and provides detailed sentiment insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For data processing and model development
- Naive Bayes Algorithm: For sentiment classification
- Streamlit: For deploying the application and creating an interactive user interface

ðŸŒŸ This project has been a fantastic opportunity to dive deeper into natural language processing and machine learning, and I'm excited to continue exploring and enhancing my skills in these areas.
